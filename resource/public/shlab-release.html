    <h1>Shell Lab Release Notes</h1>

<h2>07/28/2003</h2>
<ul>
<li> Fixed a race condition in the reference solution that happened
during the creation of a new job. The race existed between (1) the
parent adding a new job to the job list and (2) the receipt of a
SIGINT or SIGTSTP signal.  The fix is to block SIGINT and SIGTSTP
signals in the parent until after the new job has been added to the
job list. A similar race was already properly handled for SIGCHLD
signals.

<p>
<li> Also made some minor changes to the reference solution:
<ul>
<li> Changed the command line parser supplied to the students
so that characters surrounded by single quotes are treated as
a single argument. This allows the tiny shell to handle commands
such as 
<pre>
tsh> /bin/sh -c 'ps | fgrep mysplit'
</pre>
<li> Made a slight change to the formatting of job list output.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>12/05/2002</h2>
<ul>
<li> Added a new trace file (trace16.txt) that tests the shell's
ability to handle SIGINT and SIGTSTP signals that do not originate
from the terminal.
</ul>

<h2>10/16/2002</h2>
<ul>
<li> Fixed bug in tracefile <kbd>src/trace10.txt</kbd>, 
which told the driver to sleep too long before running the <kbd>fg</kbd> command.

<li> Removed assumptions in <kbd>src/Makefile</kbd> and <kbd>grade/Makefile</kbd> that the user had a "." in their Unix path.
</ul>

<h2>6/3/2002</h2>
<ul>
<li> Initial release.
</ul>
